SNMP Worker - Windows Service Wrapper
======================================
Runs the SNMP Worker as a native Windows Service using pywin32.

Benefits vs. running from cmd.exe:
  - Starts automatically at Windows boot (no user login required)
  - Runs in the background without a visible CMD window
  - Uses less CPU: the Windows SCM (Service Control Manager) manages the
    process at a lower scheduling priority than an interactive console window
  - Restarts automatically on failure
  - Proper logging via the Windows Event Log in addition to file logs

Installation (run as Administrator in the snmp_worker directory):
  python windows_service.py install
  python windows_service.py start
  python windows_service.py stop
  python windows_service.py remove

Or use the helper script:
  install_service.bat

Requires: pip install pywin32
